/*Package line is used to define lexicon line formats for parsing input and printing output.

Interfaces:

* Format - simple line format definition (field names and indices)

* Parser - a more complex parser, containing a Format definition, but also adds the possibility to write specific code for parsing that cannot be handeled by the Format specs alone (multi-value fields, etc).


THE WIKISPEECH FILE FORMAT

The Wikispeech lexicon file format is defined in ws.go. Lexicon files are tab separated text files (UTF-8 encoded), and should contain the fields listed below. Empty fields are allowed in most positions.

Any lexicon files you want to import into the lexicon database must be in this file format.

     Orth           The word's orthography
     Pos            The part of speech tag
     Morph          Morphological features (gender, number, etc)
     WordParts      Compound parts, if any, separated by a plus sign (+)
     Lemma          The word's lemma form
     Paradigm       The name of the paradigm used for inflections
     Lang           The word's language label
     Trans1         The first transcription (default for TTS)
     Translang1     The language of the Trans1
     Trans2         Alternative transcription
     Translang2     The language of the Trans2
     Trans3         Alternative transcription
     Translang3     The language of the Trans3
     Trans4         Alternative transcription
     Translang4     The language of the Trans4
     StatusName     Status of the lexicon entry
     StatusSource   Source of the status
     Preferred      Takes values 1/0, and is used to defined which reading for a specific
                    orthography should be the standard one (in case of homographs)
     Tag            A tag (string) that can be used to disambiguate between homographs if needed (default: empty)
     Comments       Comments containing a label (category), a comment (text), and a source (user or other source). It is defined using the format below. Each comment is separated by §§§ (three paragraph symbols)
                      [alabel: comment text] (source) §§§ [anotherlabel: another comment] (anothersource_or_user)
